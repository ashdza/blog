# Music feedback idea

I've been recording music for a couple of years, and usually send my recordings to a friend who both produces music for me and gives me tips on how to improve my singing in each song. He will just text me the feedback he has on the song, which can be disorganized and harder to follow than if he were in the same room as me providing feedback as I sang. However, since he lives across the country this is not possible.

I recently had an idea for a service that would make it a lot easier for me, and other singers and musicians, to share their recordings with teachers or mentors for feedback. It would be really helpful if teachers/mentors could specify which specific lyric, time, or time interval in the song they are critiquing. In addition, the ability to easily give audio as well as text feedback would be good because sometimes it is easier for the teacher/mentor to sing or play something to demonstrate what to do instead of trying to write it out. I will flesh out these ideas later.
