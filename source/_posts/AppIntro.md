# App

So, I have thought more about my idea for a music feedback service and how I could turn it into an app that people, including myself, could use. 

- Leaving feedback for specific lyrics, times or time intervals throughout the song:
    - Musician uploads lyrics to song along with recording
    - App follows lyrics w/time and teacher can leave feedback for either a specific time or  an interval of time
- Multiple types of feedback
    - Teacher can leave either text feedback or record short audio feedback
- Sharing 
    - Musicians can upload a recording and share it with specific people, whom the app will notify
    - Recordings are otherwise private
